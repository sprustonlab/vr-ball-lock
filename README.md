## Notes
Theres a very bright LED on the PCA9685 board. I couldnt remove it by desodering but the board seems to work fine after I just broke the LED with a plier.
## testing the arduino uno control
You can add a simple jumper cable between digital pin 11 and 12. This will cycle between on/off every second.
